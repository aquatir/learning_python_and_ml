<p> This is how I learned machine learning with python </p>

<p> Data in this course mostly comes from 2 coursera courses: 
  <ul>
    <li> https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/home/welcome (eng) </li>
    <li> https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematics-and-python/home/welcome (ru) </li>
   </ul>
Feel free to join them!
</p>

<p> disclaimer: I'm fully aware of the fact that storing data for machine learning in github repo is not  exactly a smart desicion and I strongly discourage you from doing so. However I personaly find this approach of the most convinience and will most likely continue to follow it, until I meet data which positively can not be stored in repo </p>

<p> upd: apparently there is such a thing as git-ldf.github.com which provides easy big files storage. I will probably move my data there sooner or later </p>
