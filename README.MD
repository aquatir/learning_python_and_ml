This is how I learned machine learning with python.

disclaimer: I'm fully aware of the fact that storing data for machine learning in github repo is not  exactly a smart desicion and I strongly discourage you from doing so. However I personaly find this approach of the most convinience and will most likely continue to follow it, until I meet data which positively can not be stored in repo

upd: apparently there is such a thing as git-ldf.github.com which provides easy big files storage. I will probably move my data there sooner or later
